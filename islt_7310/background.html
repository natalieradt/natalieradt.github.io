        <li class="header">Bye to Bags
            <ul>
                <li class="background">I’ve worked on the teen-led initiative, Bye to Bags, for nearly 4 years. Initially, I worked as a volunteer at the St. Louis zoo, educating the public about the importance of eliminating plastic bags. Being in the program taught me how to effectively communicate with people who may not share my views. Over the course of my time as a volunteer, we worked with supermarket chain, Dierbergs, to create a reusable bag that could be sold in their stores to promote our message. We also encouraged members of the public to sign a pledge committing to stop using plastic bags. Since the creation of Bye to Bags, nearly 10,000 people have signed the pledge. I learned that age should not be a factor when it comes to making an impact. Now, as a freshman in college, I am an undergraduate research assistant for a graduate student researching the impact of programs like Bye to Bags on the impact of teens. Participating in this research gives me concrete evidence that the program can have a positive impact on our community.

        <li class="header">Puppies with Purpose Merchandise
            <ul>
                <li class="background">Puppies with Purpose (PWP) is a volunteer program I joined in the fall that aims to educate the public about the importance of service dogs, as well as raising and socializing service dogs at no cost to the family that receives them. When I joined, they expressed a need to raise money, but no one seemed to have a concrete idea about how to do that, much less the means to implement that plan. Within a week, I had created an account for PWP on the popular website, RedBubble. The site allows users to purchase art on various products such as t-shirts and stickers. I created original designs to sell that would help to raise awareness as well as money to continue the program.</li>

        <li class="header">Professional Photography
            <ul>
                <li class="background">I’ve been a photographer for nearly four years now, and I’ve been taking photos professionally for more than a year. I’ve taken senior photos, graduation photos, and vacation photos on a number of occasions. My biggest regret is my initial lack of confidence in my skill. I think I could have gone so much further with my photography had I realized my talent sooner. In college, I’ve used my skill to become a photographer for The Maneater, a newspaper on campus. I’ve also created a portfolio of my most impressive shots on VSCO, a popular social media platform. Photography has taught me a lot about organization, as well as communication and money management.</li>
