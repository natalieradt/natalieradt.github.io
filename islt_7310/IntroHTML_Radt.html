 <title>Welcome to Natalie's Website</title>

 Hello everyone! My name is Natalie Radt and I am a freshman at the University of Missouri. I have absolutely no experience with web development, but I am excited to learn. I’m hoping to use my website as a kind of resume for the next four years. I’d love to have a unique way to share my skills with potential employers. I’d like to display some of my skills like wildlife photography, as well as my experience working in a few labs on campus. I also volunteered at the St. Louis zoo for 3 years, so I’d love to find a cool way to incorporate some of my cool photos and experiences from working there. I’m taking this course because it is a requirement for my major, environmental science; however, I am excited to see how I can apply this skill to my current interests.
