        <p>I’m a St. Louis native currently working on a BS degree in Environmental Science at the University of Missouri - Columbia. I plan to graduate in 2023 and hope to find a job that will allow me to pursue my passion for wildlife and environmental protection. For now, I’m participating in research and furthering my involvement in conservation efforts on campus. I hope this site helps to give you further insight into my aspirations, and allows you get to know me a little better.</p>
